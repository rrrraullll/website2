# 💌 Dear Lavanya,

Happy 20th Birthday, sayang 🎉💖

This little repo isn’t just some code — it’s a gift from me to you, something digital to show you how much I care. It’s simple, but it’s filled with my heart.

You’ve been my biggest blessing — my partner, my best friend, my peace. Every day with you feels better than the last. You give me strength, purpose, and the reason to keep pushing forward.

I love you — **today, tomorrow, and forever**.  
And I can’t wait to have you as my life partner, forever. 💍

I may not always say it perfectly, but I hope you feel how much I love and appreciate you.  
We’ve got so much ahead of us, and I’m ready for every bit of it — with you. So let’s keep **Lavin’ it at 20** 🫶

Go ahead, explore the rest of this little surprise 😉  
(Yes, there’s a game waiting for you too 😄)

With all my love,  
**Shachin**
